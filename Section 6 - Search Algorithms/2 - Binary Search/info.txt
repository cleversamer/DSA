# Binary search algorithm:
Binary search is the search technique which works efficiently on the sorted lists. Hence, in order to search an
element into some list by using binary search technique, we must ensure that the list is sorted. Binary search follows
divide and conquer approach in which, the list is divided into two halves and the item is compared with the middle element
of the list. If the match is found then, the location of middle element is returned otherwise, we search into either of
the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.

# Notes:
* Data must me sorted!
* It chooses the element in the middle of the array and then compares it against the search value.
* If element is equal to the search value, we're done!
* If element is greater than the search value, search the left-half of the array.
* If element is less than the search value, search the right-half of the array.
* At some point, there will be only one element in the partition you're checking, but it doesn't have to get to that point.
* Can be implemented recursively.
* O(log n) - keeps dividing the array in half.
