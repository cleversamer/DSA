# Bucket sort:
Bucket sort is also known as bin sort. It works by distributing the element into the array
also called buckets. Buckets are sorted individually by using different sorting algorithm.

# Notes:
* Uses hashing.
* Makes assumptions about the data, like radix and counting sort.
* Because it makes assumptions, can sort in O(n) time.
* Performs nest when hashed values of items being sorted are evenly distributed, so there aren't many collisions.
* A generalization of counting sort.
* The values in bucket (X) must be greater than the values in bucket (X - 1) and less than the values in bucket (X + 1).
* This means that the hash function we use must meet requirement.
* NOT in-place algorithm.
* Stability will depend on sort algorithm used to sort the buckets - ideally, you want a stable sort.
* To achieve O(n), must have only one item per bucket.
* Insertion sort is often used to sort the buckets, because it is fast when the number of items is small.

# Complexity:
        Worst case   Best case   Average case
Time    O(n2)        Ω(n+k)      θ(n+k)
Space                            O(1)

# Steps:
1. Distribute the items into buckets based on their hashed values (scattering phase).
2. Sort the items in each bucket.
3. Merge the buckets - can just concatenate them (gathering phase).
