Each topic is represented in a single Java project. Each Java project contains an "info.txt" file that contains all info about topic.
Each project in this repository contains two-packages:
1. javatpoint:
Contains "Main.java" class, and "debugging.txt" file to debug the code inside "Main.java" class. It covers everything inside "javatpoint website" about topic.
2. udemy:
