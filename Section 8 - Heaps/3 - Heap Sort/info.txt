# Heap Sort:
Heap sort processes the elements by creating the min heap or max heap using the elements of the given array.
Min heap or max heap represents the ordering of the array in which root element represents the minimum or 
maximum element of the array. At each step, the root element of the heap gets deleted and stored into the sorted 
array and the heap will again be heapified.

# Notes:
* We know the root has the largest value (when max heap).
* Swap root with last element in the array.
* Heapify the tree, but exclude the last node.
* After heapify, second largest element is the root.
* Rinse and repeat.
