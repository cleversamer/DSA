- Quick sort algorithm:
Is the widely used sorting algorithm that makes n log n comparisons in average case for
sorting of an array of n elements. This algorithm follows divide and conquer approach.

- Notes:
1. Divide and conquer algorithm.
2. Recursive algorithm.
3. Uses a pivot element to partition the array into two parts.
4. Elements < pivot to its left, elements > pivot to its right.
5. Pivot will then be in its correct sorted position.
6. Process is now repeated for the left array and right array.
7. Eventually, every element has been the pivot, so every element will be in its correct sorted position.
8. As with merge sort, we'll end up partitioning the array into series of 1-element arrays.
9. In-place algorithm (unlike merge sort).

- Complexity:
Complexity	Best Case	                  Average Case	Worst Case
Time	    O(n) for 3 way partition or   O(n log n)    O(n2)
            O(n log n) simple partition.
