- Recursion in Java:
Is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. A method in java that calls itself
is called recursive method. It makes the code compact but complex to understand.

This is an explanation of factorial-algorithm in a recursive method.
- Factorial Algorithm :
        1. If num is equal to 0, The factorial is 1, return.
        otherwise...
        2. Set multiplier to 1.
        3. Set factorial to 1;
        4. while multiplier is not equal to num, do steps 5 and 6.
        5. Multiply factorial by multiplier and assign the result to factorial.
        6. add 1 to multiplier.
        7. Return factorial.
