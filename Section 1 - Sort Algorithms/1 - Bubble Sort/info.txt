Bubble sort algorithm:
Each element of the array is compared with its adjacent element.The algorithm processes the list in passes.
A list with n elements requires n-1 passes for sorting.

Complexity of the algorithm:
1. Space	                  =>    O(1)
2. Worst case running time	  =>    O(n2)
3. Average case running time  =>	O(n)
4. Best case running time	  =>    O(n2)

Notes:
- This is the worst type of sort algorithms.
- It is not complex to implement.
- Stable sort algorithm.
