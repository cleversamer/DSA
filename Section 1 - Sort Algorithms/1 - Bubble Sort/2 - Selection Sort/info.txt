- Selection sort algorithm:
The smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to its appropriate
position into the array. First, find the smallest element of the array and place it on the first position. Then, find the
second smallest element of the array and place it on the second position. The process continues until we get the sorted array.\
The array with n elements is sorted by using n-1 pass of selection sort algorithm.

- Notes:
- In-place algorithm (we don't need to make a new array).
- O(n2) time complexity = quadratic.
- Does not require as much swapping as bubble sort.
- Unstable algorithm.
