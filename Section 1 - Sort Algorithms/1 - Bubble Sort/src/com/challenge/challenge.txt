#Challenge:
Using bubble sort algorithm, do the following steps to sort a specified algorithm:

1. Declare a new array of int data type with the values {1, -9, 8, -7, 22, 77, -72, 3, 2, 0, 0}.
2. Write a method called bubbleSort() that sorts the previous array in DESCENDING order.
4. Write another method called printArray() that can print the array of integers which we have declared it.

Hint: You can write a third method that can swap the elements in the array.
TIP: Try to swap elements without using a third variable.
