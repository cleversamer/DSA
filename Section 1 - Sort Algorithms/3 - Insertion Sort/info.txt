- Insertion sort algorithm:
Is the simple sorting algorithm which is commonly used in the daily lives while ordering a deck of cards.
In this algorithm, we insert each element onto its proper place in the sorted array. This is less efficient than
the other sort algorithms like quick sort, merge sort, etc.

- Notes:
1. In-place algorithm (We don't need to make a new array).
2. O(n2) time complexity - quadratic.
3. Stable algorithm.

- Complexity:
Complexity	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Time	    Ω(n)	    θ(n2)	        o(n2)
Space			                        o(1)
