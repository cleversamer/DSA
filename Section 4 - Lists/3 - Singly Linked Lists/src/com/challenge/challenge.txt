# Challenge:

* Use the SinglyLinkedList class in udemy package.
* Implement a method in the IntegerLinkedList class that inserts a value in sorted order.
* Lower values should appear first in the list (be closer to the head).
* If we insert (4, 2, 1, 5), list should looks like {1, 2, 4, 5}.
* IntegerLinkedList is a singly-linked list.
* Project contains all the code you need and an empty insertSorted() method.
* Main method contains the code that should work when you're finished.
